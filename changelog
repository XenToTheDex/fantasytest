0.5.0
30-09-2022

MAIN CHANGES

- Instead of searching up a specific URL from user input, the program now
downloads the csv from the website and uses fuzzywuzzy to search for any
names similar to user's input. It then returns a list of names that the
user can choose from. This is important as it fixes any user's typos
and makes it so any players that are related (such as the Morris
brothers) won't completely break the program. *1

-  There's now a base set of provided stats. For now it's 3pg and fg,
but it'll be subject to change based on what formula I decide to use
to rank players.

- ALOT more user friendly. Gives error messages.

*1  This issue occured before because the program had a hard-coded method
for finding the URL. It would take the base url and then take the input from the user
(for example: Marcus Morris ). The program would then adjust the first and last name
to fit the nomenclature of the website (in this example it would be morrima). The program would then apply
the number "01" to it. However, this was a problem as there were 3 (!!!) players with "morrima" as their
url ending, therefore making the last 2 unaccessable.

FUTURE UPDATES

- Ask user for specific data that they would like to pull up.

- Update list of base stats to give the most common ones.

- Create tkinter interface.

- Create formula to rank players above others.

- Make the program useful for fantasy. (Allow users to input points per stat in their league and get an expected
amount of points from player)

Once all this is done, the program will be ready for full release.
